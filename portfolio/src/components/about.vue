            <p class="content2">
                I am an undergraduate at Singapore Management University, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems. I am taking a dual track in Digitalisation & Cloud Solutions, and Smart-City Management & Technology.

                I enjoy meeting new people and hearing their stories, as I believe everyone holds a unique perspective. Working together in a team allows us to approach the same problem from multiple angles. 
                Currently seeking internship opportunities in Software Engineering, Project Management or Product Management â€“ I'm excited to leverage technology to drive meaningful change. Feel free to reach out!
